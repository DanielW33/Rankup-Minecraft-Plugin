# Rankup-Minecraft-Plugin
# Created by Daniel Williams
# Purpose: Allow players to rankup via the command /rankup then /rankup confirm
# Plugin Depends on LuckPerms as it simply moves the player along the LP Track
# Plugin Depends on Essentials because it withdraws the set balance from the player, on rankup
